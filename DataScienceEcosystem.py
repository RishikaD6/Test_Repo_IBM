# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[1]:


# Arithmetic operations
code = compile("5 + 4", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code)


# In[6]:


code1 = compile("(5 + 7) * 2", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code1)


# In[7]:


import math
# Area of square
code2 = compile("math.pow(13,2)", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code2)


# In[1]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
mins = 120
hours = mins/60
print(mins, 'Minutes= ',hours,'hours')
